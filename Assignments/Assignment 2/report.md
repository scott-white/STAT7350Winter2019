# Assignment 2: Experimental Design

## Introduction

* The idea came to me through helping out in the stats computing lab. Students often ask for help understanding concepts. Often times when I ask them which part of the concept they're having trouble understanding a typical response is "I don't know. I don't get understand what's going on", or something to that effet. Though, after talking with them for even just a minute, they start to click on some of the ideas. One theory behind why this occurs is that when students are trying to understand a concept they usually reread notes, or try to do sample problems, or redo problems that were done in class. One learning strategy that I have never come across a student telling me they tried is writing about the topic. Writing about statistical topics is not usually done in introductory statistics courses. This leaves it open for a possibility of a new strategy having a positive effect on the learning of the students. 

Thoughts on why this technique may work:

* When we think about a topic, we often think in pictures. Pictures are great, but they're also fairly abstract and thus we don't see concepts in concrete ways when we just think about them. 
* Reflective writing is often used as a tool to solve problems that we have in our life, usually of a personal or professional nature. I haven't come across reflective writing used often for learning about a topic when people are stuck. 
* It is well known that teaching someone else a concept is a great way to increase your understanding of the same concept. When we write, we're thinking to ourselves in our heads as we write. So while doing freehand writing about academic concepts we're actually talking to ourself like we might talk to someone else. So reflective writing is then a tool for teaching ourselves about a concept through asking a variety of questions. Perhaps in some ways similar to how the socratic method works.

These ideas make me think that it's possible, even likely, that having people interact with the material through writing would increase their understanding of concepts taught in an introductory statistics course. Which leads to the following question:

*What is the minimum amount of required writing needed to have a statistically significant effect on the difference between the average first midterm grade and the average second midterm grade broken down by the lower 50% of students and the upper 50% of students? The hypothesis is that there will be greater effect for the lower 50% based on the same amount of writing compared to the upper 50% of the class.*

## Motivation

The motivation of this study is to:

* Improve the performance of students taking introductory statistics courses
* Decrease the number of students who need to use the statistics help center
* Proof of concept

If this study were to give positive results, then it may be feasible to introduce this idea into other introductory statistics courses, and perhaps integrate the technique into the higher year courses through recommendation.

Considerations
1. Have the students do the writing at the end of class and let them leave when they're done their minimum writing amount. For example, if minimum amounts are 100, 200, and 500 words, if the students are given time at the beginning of class to do the writing then they may take up too much class time, but if they're asked to write that amount at the end of class and they're told they can leave when they're done then they'll have more incentive to finish quicker, and this will also have less effect of class/lab time.

2. The writing exercises could be done in the lab instead of during classtime. The lab timeslots could then be extended by about 15 minutes to incorporate the writing component without taking time from the usual lab problem solving time.

3. The students wouldn't then be required to do writing daily, only every day they have a class. So this would give a better 1:1 ratio of writing to classes attended.

Questions to address
1. What if students miss a class?
2. Could I assume access to students grades in this case? Or at least the aggregate average of their grades?

Variables gathered
* Number of classes attended
* Number of days the writing is completed
* Number of words per writing session
* Number of students who completed the first midterm
* Number of students who completed the second midterm
* Grades from the first midterm
* Grades from the second midterm
